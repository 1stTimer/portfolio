            <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Juan Cobian is like an other ordinary person in this world, hard working, dedicated,
             and willing to learn. As a child, Juan grow up with two brothers and two sisters (as you can imagine,
             life wasn't the easiest). He always dreamed of becoming a lot of things in this world, but like most,
             he decided on a different path. He is currently an unknown Construction Worker with a positive
             attitude towards anything that crosses his path. He hasn't always been a Contruction Worker, previous
             to working in this area, Juan was an independent Online Sells Rep. He worked a lot with new technolgy
             and even learn to repair computers. Learning to repair computer and other electronic devices helped him
             develop skills in areas he would of never imagined possible. Now, working as a Construction Worker he
             is also establishing himself as a "Unicorn," learning to do more than just sell and repair computers.
             He has the experience to sell, repair, or even construct his way out of any issue that may arise in his
             way.</p>

            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>His interest in hobbies is not the most intriguing or eyebrow raising, but he does enjoy
             spending time with his family. Juan enjoys the casual day at home watching his favorite sports teams play
            (obviously not when they lose but still supports them). Playing video games was a big part of his life for
            a very longtime, until he has to get serious and get a job that brought his gaming life to an unfortunate
            end.</p>
