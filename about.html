            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Juan Cobian is like an other ordinary person in this world, hard working, dedicated,
                and willing to learn. As a child, Juan grow up with two brothers and two sisters (as you can imagine,
                life wasn't the easiest). He always dreamed of becoming a lot of things in this world, but like most,
                he decided on a different path.
                <br>
                <br>
                He is currently an unknown Construction Worker with a positive
                attitude towards anything that crosses his path. He hasn't always been a Contruction Worker, previous
                to working in this area, Juan was an independent Online Sells Rep. He worked a lot with new technolgy
                and even learn to repair computers.
                <br>
                <br>
                Learning to repair computer and other electronic devices helped him
                develop skills in areas he would of never imagined possible. Now, working as a Construction Worker he
                is also establishing himself as a "Unicorn," learning to do more than just sell and repair computers.
                He has the experience to sell, repair, or even construct his way out of any issue that may arise in his
                way.</p>
